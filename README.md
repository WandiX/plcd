1. Introduction

PLCD (Product Line Change Detector) is a Java-based application that compares the product line changes between two products P1 and P2 in a product line. PLCD is designed to process SysML model files generated by Papyrus. It also takes change logs, FMECA, and valid unit lists to filter out expected changes and rank unexpected changes.

2. Inputs

PLCD takes the following inputs:
1) SysML Block Definition Diagram (BDD) and Parametric Diagram (PD) for P1 and P2: These files need be generated by Papyrus 
2) Change Log: The table that records all the changes needed
3) Change List: The table that records specific SysML artifact changes that Change Log leads to
4) FMECA (Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis) for P1 and P2
5) Customized Unit List: The table that lists valid units defined by users

3. Outputs

PLCD produces the following outputs:
1) Fixed SysML Block Definition Diagram (BDD) and Parametric Diagram (PD) for P2
2) A generated report that records the updates

4. How to use

1) Copy and paste the inputs with required filenames to corresponding folders under the root XMIParser folder:
a) SysML models: Put model1.notation, model1.uml, model2.notation, model2.uml to folder xmi (model.notation and model.uml     are automatically generated by Papyrus)
b) Changes: Put ChangeList.csv and ChangeLog.csv to change folder
c) FMECA: Put Priority1.csv and Priority2.csv to priority folder 
d) Unit Lists: Put CustomList.csv to units folder

2) Open the project in Eclipse (Photon) and run then select the issues needs to be updated in the interface. Then press "Generete Report" button to generate the update report. The updated SysML models will be in res folder. The report will be in report folder.
